There are plenty of SPICE subcircuits floating around online that claim to model the behavior of memristors. But every one of them that Iâ€™ve seen takes existing SPICE components, and gloms them together to essentially emulate memristor behavior.  As such, the existing subcircuits all suffer from the same deficiency: none of them can be as good or as accurate as a built-in SPICE model.  The goal of this project is to produce a modified version of SPICE that allows for quick and accurate prototyping of memristor circuits.
